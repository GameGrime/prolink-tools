Prolink Tools is a collection of tools that can be used to interact with the
Pioneer Pro DJ Link functionality that many of Pioneer's DJ equipment is
compatible with.
[Read the User Manual](https://prolink.tools/manual) to get started

### Features

- **Device status panel**  
  The device status panel provides a at-a-glance overview of the payers and
  devices on the Pro DJ Link network.

- **Livestream overlays**  
  Easily configure and use overlays to display information directly from your
  CDJs in livestreams using tools like the
  [OBS](<[https://obsproject.com/](https://obsproject.com/)>)'s [browser
  source](<[https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/browser-plugin.115/](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/browser-plugin.115/)>).

- **Full metadata capabilities**  
  The software is able to read track metadata when tracks are played through
  Rekordbox or loaded from a USB drive / SD card plugged into the CDJs.

### How It Works

Pioneer DJ gear equipped with the PRO DJ LINK feature are able to communicate
to each other over a network interface. By reverse engineering this protocol
we're able to talk with and understand the information that the CDJs report.

This project is in large part thanks to the work done [Deep-Symmetry/dysentery](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/dysentery).
